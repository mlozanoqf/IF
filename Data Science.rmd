# `r fontawesome::fa("code")` Data science.

Data science is the study of the generalizable extraction of knowledge from data. Being a data scientist requires an integrated skill set spanning operations research, statistics, and computer science along with a good understanding of crafting a problem formulation in a specific field for effective solutions. This course will introduce you to this rapidly growing field and equip you with some of its basic principles and tools as well as its general mindset in the context of business. Ideally, you will learn to apply financial and economic concepts, models, techniques and tools to review various facets of data science practice, including data collection and integration, exploratory data analysis, descriptive and predictive modeling, visualization, evaluation, and effective communication. See @hull2020machine for a good introduction to the world of data science applied to finance.

You are not going to become a data scientist in this course. Although you can always specialize in this field in your further postgraduate studies. Nowadays, most undergraduate students recognize that they need some knowledge of data science and machine learning to survive in a world where jobs are increasingly impacted by these areas. Yesterday, all executives needed to know how to use computers. Today, all executives will need to be comfortable managing large data sets and working with data science professionals to innovate and boost their productivity.

Learning these computational skills is consistent with the purpose of developing STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics) skills in your undergraduate studies. I believe learning opportunities for undergraduate students should include authentic tasks set in a real-world context. Authentic tasks consist of ill-defined problems, complex or multi-step questions, multiple ways to approach a problem and sub-tasks that integrate across disciplines. Some of these STEAM principles and ideas are incorporated in several learning activities in this course.

Data science is strongly linked with finance and economics. Here, we will incorporate data science concepts and tools in the context of *digital humanities*. Digital humanities is a field of study, research, teaching, and invention concerned with the intersection of computing and the disciplines of the humanities, including economics and finance. It is methodological by nature and interdisciplinary in scope. It involves investigation, analysis, synthesis and presentation of information in electronic form. It studies how these media affect the disciplines in which they are used, and what these disciplines have to contribute to our knowledge of computing. 

If you are interested to know more about the concept and the current vibrant discussion about digital humanities, please see @klein2019debates, and to know more about data science and data ethics that is informed by the ideas of intersectional feminism, which is consistent with fifth United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, gender equality @UN17, see @d2020data.

## `r fontawesome::fa("r-project")`, a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics.

This course incorporates data science, data analysis and computational finance with R @Rcitation to learn the main subject. Therefore, you will learn or continue learning to code as this will enhance your possibilities to apply economic and finance models in practical situations. It is true that this is not a computer science course, and we have a limited amount of time to review the compulsory finance-related material. This is why you will learn by doing the assignments, collaborating with other colleagues, doing [Swirl](https://swirlstats.com/) online lessons and/or [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/) courses to learn R. R is a programming language and free software environment for statistical computing and graphics supported by the R Foundation for Statistical Computing. The R language is widely used among statisticians and data miners for developing statistical software and data analysis. The barriers to getting started with R are currently very low because there are plenty of free resources available on the Internet, you only have to allocate the right amount of time and effort to learn. Probably the most important barrier is that some people might think computer programming is difficult, once they realize it is not as difficult then things improve significantly.

You may know that just a few years ago, those economic agents who had privileged access to information had a clear comparative advantage in business and overall decision taking. Today, information and data are pretty much available to everyone thanks to technology, and as a consequence the possibility to achieve an advantage simply due to information access has vanished. Now that data availability per-se is no longer a comparative advantage in business, knowledge has become a critical aspect in business. Nowadays, it is not about having access to information; it is about knowing what to do with increasing amounts of it to create value in business. Manipulating and transforming data into business tools and decisions has become a required skill for all business professionals.

There are many ways in which you can learn basic data science, or how to transform information into valuable business intelligence, but I consider learning to code is one of them. This is because computer coding allows you to train your brain to think more efficiently and more productively to solve complex problems and come up with innovative solutions. In this course, you will learn how to use R, a free computer language which allows branching and looping as well as doing modular programming using functions. Today, the Finance job market is increasingly demanding for candidates with some knowledge in the field of data science or computational finance, mainly because this boosts creative problem-solving skills and data analysis abilities.

According to my view, English is the leading language for doing research and business; math and statistics are the languages used to understand nature; and R is one of the most popular languages to communicate directly to a computer to conduct statistical experiments in the context of business. Given that computers are and will be part of our lives, we better learn how to communicate with them not only as a limited plain and boring user level but as a programmer level. As young professionals, it is important to differentiate yourselves with the rest of your colleagues and be prepared for the changing job market conditions in the area of financial economics. My view is that you are expected to be as proficient as possible in these three ways to interact with our environment regardless of your own professional expertise: English, math, and coding. 

If you still do not believe me, listen to Steve Jobs:

```{r echo=FALSE}
embed_url("https://youtu.be/BRTOlPdyPYU")
```

If you have not yet the program in your computer, please download R and RStudio from <https://www.r-project.org/> and <https://www.rstudio.com/> respectively. There are some nice YouTube installation guides in the reference list (at the end of this document) that explains how to download and install R and RStudio from scratch. Those videos have been useful for my previous students. However, if you find a new and better video please share. 

During your undergraduate studies, you will be expected to learn a bunch of good commercial software such as Microsoft Excel, SPSS, STATA, E-Views and many others. I truly encourage you to learn them as good as you can, especially if your professor asks you. However, you will have to be aware that these programs are fully controlled by private firms who seek to create value for their shareholders, so there is no guarantee that their associated file formats could be readable in the future, or even exist in the future, which negatively impacts reproducibility. I will never advise you not to learn commercial software like the ones listed above; but I will always encourage you to consider the alternative to learn and use R, Python or others for serious data analysis in the area of economics and finance. These computer languages are user-oriented and are created and constantly improved by a growing scientific community with an immense online presence to assist enthusiastic beginners like you.

Commercial software products as the ones listed above are definitely important in the job market, but you also should realize that the main interaction with these programs is by using the mouse to click on pre-defined, limited and inflexible menus. This kind of user-interaction is most of the times ephemeral and unrecorded, so that many of the choices made during a full quantitative procedure are frequently undocumented and this turns out to be highly problematic because there is no trace about how an analysis was conducted, and also because it becomes hard to propose an extension to the analysis in phases or replication in different contexts. In contrast, coding allows us to conduct and develop reproducible research. Learning how to code is equivalent to writing a cooking recipe and every time you click *run* you get the dish done. If you want chocolate instead of vanilla, you do not need to start your cake from scratch, you only have to change the flavor parameter from vanilla to chocolate, click *run* and voilà. Although chefs have to pay for ovens, kitchen items and even ingredients, while in economics and finance most of our inputs are free data and the technology is also free, as R is an open source software. So, by learning how to code, you can share, expand, reproduce and innovate on your own to the point of producing original empirical results that are important inputs for research outputs as in the case of your dissertation or other professional projects. My suggestion is: *stop clicking and start scripting*. 

Look at this video to find out:

```{r echo=FALSE}
embed_url("https://youtu.be/hb7Q33ysCwI")
```

Commercial products have high licensing fees and also rely on mysterious *black boxes* to produce a battery of results. These black boxes are problematic because the data comes in and the result comes out as magic, showing no details about the assumptions and procedure followed to produce the final results, and the user could sadly get the wrong illusion that he or she can do data analysis. This might be convenient in some specific and limited cases, but in others you miss the fun that represents having access to all the details of the computation and limit the extent to which you can customize or extend to innovative and create new improved applications. The general alternative to using a point-and-click program is to familiarize with languages like R which allows writing scripts to program algorithms for economic and financial analysis and visualisation. 

This is a good video that summarizes these ideas:

## Deepnote `r fontawesome::fa("heart")` `r fontawesome::fa("r-project")`.

[Deepnote](https://deepnote.com/) is a cloud-based new kind of [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) compatible data notebook built for collaboration. Most of the graded activities in this course are conducted in Deepnote. Deepnote allows you to easily work on your data science projects, together in real-time and in one place with your colleagues. Deepnote is usually a pay service, but I have free access because I requested it for educational purposes, so it is free for you as well. Please bear in mind that Deepnote is a service provided by a private company, so their policies may change and they could eventually cancel free access. 

Deepnote is built for the browser so you can use it across any platform (Windows, Mac, Linux or Chromebook). No downloads required, with frequent updates and all changes instantly saved. In the background, Deepnote is running on powerful machines in the cloud. Notebooks are the heart of Deepnote, they are a rich computational medium which combines blocks of code including R and Python, text, charts, SQL queries, among others. 

I recommend you to take the following Deepnote crash course: [click here.](https://docs.deepnote.com/getting-started/deepnote-crash-course-videos)

The basic Deepnote structure is as follows:

* **A workspace.** The workspace name is formed by the semester ID and the course ID. It also has a workspace picture and it is located at the top left corner. In particular, I teach S23ARF1 (yellow cat), S23ARF2 (red bird), S23EMF (a dog), and S23IF (a frog). 
* **Projects.** Every workspace has at least 3 projects. One is called as the course name (ARF1, ARF2, EMF, or IF) and the entire class can edit its contents. The second is a read-only project and collects feedback, activities instructions and exam solutions. The third project is called as your group name which is the name of a Jupiter moon, this project is private as only your group and I will be able to edit the contents. I do not recommend you to create new projects as by default they will be running a Python kernel. Instead, you can create a new notebook within your private project with the *Create a new notebook* option, this will allow you to create a notebook with an R kernel.
* **Notebooks.** Every project has notebooks, I usually start notebooks with a panda picture. Notebooks are *.ipynb* files or Jupyter Notebooks. They include code, narrative text, equations, and rich output. In sum, in your course workspace you will find assignment instructions in the read-only project in the form of a notebook. You can then export the *.ipynb* file with the assignment instructions with the *Export as ipynb* option, and then upload the instructions in your group project with the *Upload ipynb file* option. By the end of the semester you will not have further access to the course workspace, but you can export your notebooks to your own personal workspace if you want to. 

I personally use cloud-based alternatives like [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) when I need a lot computational resources such as Graphics Processor Unit (GPU) or a Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), I also use Deepnote when I require real-time collaboration features and when I teach. I also have several free IDE (Integrated Development Environment) installed on my computer like [RStudio](https://posit.co/), [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/). If you ask, my favorite is RStudio, in fact his syllabus has been created in RStudio with R markdown. Working with a cloud-based alternative versus a locally installed IDE is like working with Google Docs versus MS-Word. I believe we are all used to working locally and in the cloud, and we are all used to dealing with data privacy issues and backing up our files regularly. 

I anticipate that some of you might be frustrated because you may think programming is very difficult. At this moment you might wonder why you are expected to get into such a painful process. The answer is that it is not that painful and you will discover a fascinating whole new world with respect to the free open source software, the generous online community, and you will get to know some of the ultimate innovation advances in terms of scientific document production with virtually no limits compared with other commercial software. Learning new things is one of the things you do at University and this is only one of many new things you will learn. At the beginning, learning new languages like R requires some time and effort, but I guarantee the benefit is much greater than the time and effort invested. As a student, sometimes you need to know which are the important doors that will lead to new and valuable knowledge, so this is definitely one of them. Do not let temporary frustration damper your learning experience at the University.

<!-- ## RStudio. -->

<!-- The difference between R and RStudio (@RStudiocitation) is that R is the main program whereas RStudio represents the open-source integrated development environment to develop data science projects. In other words, RStudio is the user-friendly interface and the main program that runs internally in your computer is R, so you need to download and install both, but you will only need to open RStudio to work with R. In practical terms, you will spend your time programming directly in RStudio and internally your computer will call R to do all calculations. RStudio also makes it easy to combine R and Python (among other computer languages) in a single data science project, which is very convenient when the work team is bilingual in the context of computer programming languages.  -->

<!-- First time users of R are often confused as to the difference between R and RStudio. RStudio is actually an add-on to R: it takes the R software and adds to it a very user-friendly graphical interface. In simple terms, consider R as a car's powerful engine, and RStudio as a very modern and convenient car's dashboard. Thus, when we use RStudio, we are still using the full version of R while also getting the benefit of greater functionality and usability due to an improved RStudio user interface. -->

<!-- ## R markdown. -->

<!-- You may be quite familiar with using MS-Word to produce reports. The process is simple as you start with a MS-Word document and your final result is a MS-Word or perhaps a PDF document. However, taking a pdf file and converting it into a webpage or MS-Word document is not that easy as it requires a lot of editing. In fact, this is usually a painful and timely process. RStudio allow you to produce professional documents in a wide variety of types including finished web page, PDF, MS Word document, slide show, presentations, handout, book (see for example <https://otexts.com/fpp3/>), dashboard, package vignette, shiny applications (see for example <https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/>), scientific articles, academic thesis, among others. R markdown files have an rmd extension and this source file can be easily converted into a wide and growing different and convenient alternatives as listed above. -->

<!-- ![](syllabus.png){width="100%"} -->

<!-- You will use RStudio not only to write your R code in this course, but also to produce (typesetting) the whole PDF assignment reports that you will submit. There is an online course in Datacamp called Reporting with R Markdown (Amy Peterson). If you have not taken it yet, I strongly recommend you to complete it as soon as possible. -->

<!-- A typical assignment report in my courses is a PDF document with a simple cover page, introduction (text), content (text, tables, figures, R code), conclusion (text), and references if applicable. In this course you will write the whole assignment report in RStudio, using the R Markdown package to produce the PDF final document. This is, knit a rmd file into a PDF. This task is not minor. For starters, this means that you will need to get familiar with \LaTeX, a high-quality typesetting system, to create your assignment reports. As an example, in \LaTeX you type: `$\displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n}$` and the PDF output looks like this: -->

<!-- $\displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n}$, or this $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n}$. -->

<!-- \LaTeX is a computer programming language used for typesetting technical documents, and fortunately RStudio and R Markdown makes it easier to deal with \LaTeX. Learning how to use R Markdown to write formal reports is not an insignificant format issue; it is rather an opportunity to get to know and develop a new branch of skills that are very well aligned with the fourth industrial revolution and with the free data science technology. Eventually, you will learn that creating scientific documents that integrate code, output and analysis with R Markdown is easy if you use RStudio. See @xie2020r for a complete reference about R Markdown. -->

<!-- R Markdown requires you to download and install the full version of MiK\TeX  which is available here <https://miktex.org/download>. Please see <https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/> and <https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_quick_tour.html> for further details on this topic. -->

<!-- Installing the full version of MiK\TeX can be troublesome if you are not quite familiar with software installation. For this reason, Yihui Xie created a package in R that essentially does everything automatically: Tiny\TeX. I use MiK\TeX and I am not familiar with Tiny\TeX. However, it seems like a good alternative according to my students. I added a YouTube video that explains how to install Tiny\TeX in the reference list by the end of this syllabus. Most of my students use Tiny\TeX and they have had no issues at all. -->

<!-- It is common to get error messages when trying to produce an R Markdown PDF in RStudio, and people might find it hard to get the PDF done especially if this is their first time dealing with \LaTeX. In this respect, my best advice is to Google your question or the error message to find out the answer to your specific case. Fortunately, there is a very kind and growing community online that helps each other in a wide variety of data science topics at all levels of expertise. In my case, every time I have a question about programming, I find my answer online. I am not suggesting to Google the questions of your learning activities, but to Google how to deal with specific programming issues or specific error messages.  -->

<!-- ## \faGithub \hspace{1 mm} GitHub. -->

<!-- Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large software projects with speed and efficiency. GitHub is the user-friendly interface of Git. Just as RStudio is a user-friendly interface of R. Therefore, you need to download and install Git (<https://git-scm.com/>) in order to sign up for a GitHub account. I use the web based client of GitHub, although others prefer the GitHub desktop version. I consider you will be OK with the web based client as well. -->

<!-- GitHub is a website and cloud-based service that helps developers store and manage their code, as well as track and control changes to their code and projects. GitHub is one of the world's largest communities of open source code developers. It fosters collaboration and communication between developers similar to a social network of coders. GitHub has a number of useful features that enable development teams to work together on the same project and easily track changes made by collaborators, and create new versions of software without disrupting the current versions. In this sense, GitHub is similar to Google Docs, but far, far more powerful and flexible. -->

<!-- I recommend you to use GitHub in your team in order to collaborate on your own homework assignments that require coding. My PEF students are required to use GitHub to collaborate on their project. -->

<!-- ## R, RStudio, R markdown, \LaTeX, Git, GitHub. -->

<!-- At this point you should be wondering how you are going to work with all these new software, languages and interfaces. First, you have to download and install the main base programs which are R and Git. There are some YouTube installation guides available at the end of this document, if you find better/newer videos please let me know to update this section. Second, you have to download and install RStudio and sign up for a free GitHub account. Third, you have to install the Tiny\TeX and the R markdown packages in RStudio so you can create your PDF assignment reports. You will work in your local computer using RStudio, and you will produce rmd files which will allow you to produce PDF documents. You will also have to collaborate so here comes the fourth step. Fourth, you have to learn how to integrate RStudio with GitHub. You have some nice YouTube videos to explain how to deal with this integration at the end of this document. This RStudio and GitHub integration will allow you to collaborate with others. Fifth, during all these steps you will need to take some DataCamp courses that can help you to learn how to code in R. In the course calendar you can see a list of courses that you will need to take in this course. -->

<!-- It is common that some students get familiar very quickly with these previous steps, especially with the installation steps. If you are one of those, I may need your help to assist other students that struggle with the download and installation process. If you are interested in helping me with this, please contact me and I can compensate for your extra work with stickers (see what they are later in this syllabus). Your job will be to help me with the questions I may receive throughout the semester. -->
