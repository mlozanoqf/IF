# `r fontawesome::fa("info-circle")` Course overview.

In this section I describe and explain the course objectives, mechanics, and important information about academic integrity.

## `r fontawesome::fa("cogs")` IF description.

<!-- EMF. `r fontawesome::fa("chart-line")` The course incorporates a COIL (Collaborative Online International Learning) activity with students from Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana in Colombia, aiming to foster intercultural understanding among students. Econometrics is a branch of economics that utilizes mathematical and statistical methods to describe economic systems. In the context of finance, financial econometrics applies statistical techniques to address problems specific to the field. For instance, while we may know from previous courses that there exists a negative relationship between interest rates and stock prices, econometrics allows us to measure and assess the strength and dynamics of this relationship. Moreover, financial econometrics enables us to incorporate data into existing financial models, empirically testing their validity and obtaining estimates that are significantly more reliable than informal guesses or estimations.

Forecasting is a key aspect of financial econometrics and holds great importance in decision-making processes across various areas of a company. This course primarily focuses on forecasting methods commonly used in finance and economics. Forecasting entails predicting the future as accurately as possible, leveraging available information such as historical data and awareness of potential future events that might impact the forecasts. This subject is valuable in bridging the gap between being a student and becoming a practitioner in the finance field. We will also explore computational finance using R and Python as a means to learn financial econometrics.

The main electronic textbooks recommended for this course are: @49018680cf534023b6ae0f4e933c475d, and @lozanoEMF. Additionally, there are other highly regarded reference books that employ R, such as: @hanck2020introduction, @gujarati2012basic, @brooks2019introductory, @Oswaldeconometrics, @heiss2020usingR and @mcnulty2021handbook, @RundelIntroduction, @james2013introduction. For Python enthusiasts, see @heiss2020usingPython is a recommended resource. Please refer to the course calendar provided at the end of this syllabus for a detailed overview of topics, activities, and required readings. -->

<!-- Financial risk management involves the identification, quantification, and mitigation of financial risks. In this course, our focus is on credit risk models and their practical implementation using R and Python. Credit risk refers to the potential loss arising from a borrower's failure to make payments on their debt obligations. Managing credit risk involves measuring the probability of default and the associated potential losses to minimize financial losses. While traditional courses often concentrate on studying firms, this course also incorporates the analysis of credit risk at the individual and country levels, providing a broader perspective and enabling the application of financial and economic analysis. -->

<!-- This course can be viewed as having two main pillars. The first pillar covers modern techniques and methodologies used to identify, quantify, and manage financial risks, particularly credit risk. The second pillar focuses on developing analytical skills and understanding the key financial and economic challenges specific to México. -->

<!-- The main textbooks recommended for this course are: @Hull9, which covers influential credit risk models widely used in the financial industry; @crouhy2014essentials and @brealey2020principles, which provide comprehensive analyses of various sources of risk in financial markets; and @lozanoARF, which bridges the gap between theoretical model analysis and practical computational modeling using R. Complementing these resources, @hull2020machine and @james2013introduction are recommended as additional reference books. -->

<!-- Please refer to the course calendar provided at the end of this syllabus for a detailed overview of the topics, activities, and required readings. -->

Engineering is a field of science and technology that focuses on the design, construction, and utilization of engines, machines, and structures. Similarly, financial engineering involves the design, modeling, and utilization of various financial techniques and instruments to develop strategies that modify or mitigate specific risk exposures. In this course, you will learn how to create quantitative financial strategies, understand financial instruments like options, and become familiar with tools and techniques used to measure risk in finance, such as value at risk and GARCH models.

The course primarily relies on the renowned textbook by John C. Hull, @Hull9, which is widely recognized as an essential reference in both academia and the financial industry. This course serves as a solid foundation for students aspiring to pursue a master's degree in Finance or seeking professional certification in the field of quantitative finance. Another valuable resource for this course is @lozanoIF, which effectively combines model analysis with practical computational modeling using R. Additionally, @goetzmann2014modern is a recommended complementary reference book as it offers a comprehensive and up-to-date presentation of modern portfolio analysis. Other useful references include @brealey2020principles, @ruppert2011statistics, and @james2013introduction, which strike a balance between theoretical aspects and practical applications.

One of the remarkable aspects of financial engineering is its ability to integrate knowledge from related fields such as computational finance, financial derivatives, and statistics, enabling innovative solutions and informed financial decision-making.

Please refer to the course calendar provided at the end of this syllabus for a detailed overview of the topics, activities, and required readings.

<!-- PMF. Traditional financial models, characterized by their assumptions, principles, functions, and equations, serve as essential tools for making informed financial decisions. However, by leveraging relevant technology, these models can be translated into computational code, marking the initial step towards automation and expanding the possibilities and boundaries of financial analysis. This course combines financial analysis with financial modeling, aiming to transform paper-based models into functional computational code. Proficiency in such skills is currently in high demand and highly valued not only in the job market but also in research, FinTech, and innovation projects.

The primary textbook for this course is @lozanoPMF, specifically designed to bridge the gap between model analysis and its implementation through computational modeling in R. Additionally, some recommended complementary reference books include @hull2020machine, @james2013introduction, and @ruppert2011statistics.

Please refer to the course calendar provided at the end of this syllabus for a comprehensive overview of the topics, activities, and required readings. -->

<!-- EFPI. \faSearchDollar \hspace{1 mm} Investment is commonly recognized as a catalyst for growth within both firms and countries. However, investment decisions can have adverse outcomes due to economic conditions or inadequate risk assessment. This course delves into the fundamentals and advanced techniques used to evaluate investment projects, which can encompass financial products such as investment funds or entire firms. Investment projects typically involve an upfront payment in exchange for future cash flows. The challenge arises when these projects fail to generate the anticipated cash flows. Evaluating investment projects helps us assess their riskiness in relation to the promised future cash flows. Through analysis and evaluation, we gain insights into how to enhance their attractiveness and distinguish between sound and poor investment decisions. Our primary textbook for this course is @brealey2020principles. -->

<!-- MPA. Economics is a social science that enables us to comprehend how resources are allocated to fulfill human needs. Unlike natural laws in physics or chemistry, the allocation of resources in economics is based on human behavior and choices. This course focuses on microeconomics, which examines the economic behavior of individual agents, such as firms. In contrast, macroeconomics studies the collective behavior of multiple agents.

Microeconomics helps us understand how individual agents, including firms, consumers, and governments, make rational decisions when faced with limited resources and unlimited wants and needs. This segmentation allows us to analyze the interactions between preferences, incentives, objectives, and constraints within each economic agent. For instance, individuals aim to increase their well-being by consuming goods and services, but they are limited by their budget, which consists of income and wealth. Similarly, firms face regulatory issues, costs, financial constraints, market conditions, and imperfect information, while striving to maximize profits. Governments, on the other hand, ideally seek to provide public goods, reduce poverty, promote welfare, and ensure a competitive environment, but they are constrained by limited tax resources and misaligned incentives.

Understanding microeconomics empowers economic agents to make better-informed decisions based on a scientific approach rather than relying solely on intuition. Since this process of resource allocation is perpetual in real-life situations, individuals who grasp the foundations of microeconomic analysis gain a significant comparative advantage in business and management. Therefore, it is essential to comprehend microeconomics early on in undergraduate studies. -->

The actual learning process will be more intricate and involve a comprehensive exploration of the course topics, hands-on exercises, and practical applications.

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Initial condition.
learn <- FALSE
# Initial inputs assigned to study the topic.
inputs <- c(read, time, effort, assistance, others)
# Learning process.
while (learn == FALSE) {
  understand <- study(inputs) # Evaluate study function.
  if (understand == FALSE) {
    print("Add more inputs and try again.")
    inputs <- inputs + 1
    }
  else { # Understanding is the way to learn.
    learn == TRUE
    print ("Well done!")
  }
  }
```

Remember, persistence and determination are key to the learning process. Persistence refers to the quality or ability to continue striving towards a goal or completing a task despite facing difficulties, obstacles, or setbacks. It involves determination, perseverance, and the willingness to keep working towards a desired outcome, even when faced with challenges or discouragement. Persistence often requires a strong sense of motivation, resilience, and the ability to maintain focus and effort over an extended period of time. It is a valuable trait that can contribute to personal and professional success in various areas of life. By dedicating yourself to reading, working hard, and seeking assistance when needed, you will enhance your understanding and excel in the course.

```


In accordance with some of [The Sustainable Development Goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals) by the United Nations, see @UN17, all the compulsory readings and activity submissions are available in electronic format. Other complementary materials and activities may be incorporated or altered during the semester, depending on relevant news or events that do not currently exist or are hard to anticipate at the beginning of the semester. If that is the case, I will inform you in advance. As a student, you should be confident that all the course materials and activities are perfectly suitable for an undergraduate student enrolled in a prestigious world-class university. In other words, there will not be an intellectual challenge that you cannot overcome with the appropriate amount of enthusiasm, time, work, determination, and, if necessary, assistance. This course is designed in such a way that you can pass and learn as long as you invest the right amount of time and work.

I assume you are aware of the academic regulations dictated by the university. If you are not familiar with them, please review the corresponding student regulations. In this course, we will adhere to those regulations.

## `r fontawesome::fa("thumbs-up")` Academic integrity.

Individuals with integrity demonstrate a high level of moral character and ethics, choosing to do what is right even when faced with difficult decisions or temptations. They are trustworthy, reliable, and have a strong sense of accountability. Integrity is an essential quality in personal relationships, professional settings, and society as a whole, as it fosters trust, respect, and fairness.

We pledge to uphold the highest standards of honesty and integrity, both for ourselves and our peers. Violations of academic integrity, including plagiarism and cheating, are strictly prohibited and may result in consequences such as failure of assignments, failure of the course, and additional disciplinary actions as per current regulations. Plagiarism is defined as presenting another person's thoughts or words as one's own, without proper acknowledgment or attribution. This includes copying from textbooks, other sources (including the Internet), or any material without giving due credit to the original source.

Please watch the following video about plagiarism taken from [York St. John University](https://www.yorksj.ac.uk/) about understanding plagiarism.

```{r echo=FALSE}
embed_url("http://youtu.be/ptHIA5bMnio")
```

I strongly advise against constructing a piece of work by simply cutting and pasting or copying material written by others into something you submit as your own. Regardless of any pressure you may feel to complete an assignment, it is important to never succumb to the temptation of taking a shortcut and using someone else's material inappropriately. This includes ChatGPT and other generative AI tools as this is a form of plagiarism with potentially serious consequences. You are free to use these AI as a learning tool, but not to answer graded activities. 

See the following video to illustrate this point:

```{r echo=FALSE}

```

Ethical behavior is implicit in the course mechanics and rules, and it will be explicit in several topics throughout the course material. Following the indications of this syllabus is a simple way and a clear example regarding how we can effectively pursue ethical behavior. Ethics concerns are inherent in business, economics and finance activities because the professionals in these fields frequently manage resources to achieve a range of objectives, not exclusively maximize profits. Pursuing ethical behavior also helps us to build solid institutions, which is consistent with the [United Nations 17 sustainable development goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals), @UN17. Managing own or third-party resources entails a high degree of responsibility because people often face the alternative to apply unethical strategies to achieve their own interests. A proper discussion of the ethical aspect in the decision-taking process including conflict of interests is necessary to increase the awareness of young professionals like you. In the end, following an ethical code as a business practice can contribute to strengthening or building your own reputation -- one of the most significant assets you have, or are currently building.

Take a look at this video about integrity.

Integrity is particularly crucial in the realm of finance professionals due to the following reasons:

1. **Trust and credibility.** Finance professionals handle sensitive financial information, make critical financial decisions, and often act as stewards of other people's money. Integrity is essential to establish and maintain trust and credibility with clients, investors, and stakeholders. Clients need to trust that their financial advisor or accountant will act in their best interests, provide accurate information, and handle their funds responsibly.

2. **Ethical responsibility.** Finance professionals have a significant ethical responsibility to act in an ethical and responsible manner. They must adhere to ethical codes of conduct, such as those set by professional organizations, and follow legal and regulatory requirements. Acting with integrity ensures that financial professionals prioritize ethical behavior, avoid conflicts of interest, and make decisions that are in the best interest of their clients or organizations.

3. **Confidentiality and privacy.** Finance professionals often have access to confidential financial information, including personal and sensitive data. Integrity is crucial in maintaining the privacy and confidentiality of this information. Professionals must handle financial data responsibly, protect client information, and maintain the highest standards of confidentiality and data security.

4. **Risk management.** Financial decisions and transactions involve risks, and integrity plays a critical role in managing these risks. Acting with integrity helps finance professionals accurately assess and communicate risks to clients or stakeholders. It involves being honest about the potential risks involved in investments, disclosing relevant information, and ensuring transparency in financial reporting.

5. **Compliance and regulatory requirements.** Finance professionals must adhere to various legal and regulatory requirements in their work. Integrity is essential in complying with these regulations, reporting accurate financial information, and avoiding fraudulent or deceptive practices. Acting with integrity helps professionals maintain compliance with laws such as anti-money laundering regulations, financial reporting standards, and tax laws.

6. **Professional reputation.** The finance industry relies heavily on reputation and credibility. Finance professionals with a reputation for integrity are more likely to attract clients, secure partnerships, and build long-term relationships. Conversely, a lack of integrity can quickly damage a professional's reputation and have long-lasting negative consequences.

7. **Industry ethics and public trust.** The finance industry plays a significant role in the economy and society at large. Maintaining integrity within the industry is crucial for public trust and confidence in the financial system. Finance professionals with integrity contribute to the overall reputation and trustworthiness of the industry, helping to foster a healthy and reliable financial environment.

In summary, integrity is vital for finance professionals to establish trust, uphold ethical standards, protect confidentiality, manage risks, comply with regulations, maintain a strong professional reputation, and contribute to the overall integrity of the finance industry.

## `r fontawesome::fa("envira")` Sustainable finance. 

I am certified as 'carbon literate' by the [UN Climate Change Conference](https://unfccc.int/) and [Coventry University](https://www.coventry.ac.uk/). The certification represents a robust understanding of the climate context and a commitment to recognizing ways to adjust our behavior to reduce our carbon footprint, as well as influencing our social and professional circles. My view is that one way of achieving a positive impact on the environment and society is to learn more about sustainable finance.

According to the [European Commission](https://commission.europa.eu/index_en), sustainable finance refers to the process of taking environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations into account when making investment decisions in the financial sector, leading to more long-term investments in sustainable economic activities and projects. Environmental considerations might include climate change mitigation and adaptation, as well as the environment more broadly, for instance the preservation of biodiversity, pollution prevention and the circular economy. Social considerations could refer to issues of inequality, inclusiveness, labour relations, investment in human capital and communities, as well as human rights issues. The governance of public and private institutions – including management structures, employee relations and executive remuneration – plays a fundamental role in ensuring the inclusion of social and environmental considerations in the decision-making process.

In this course, you will be exposed to an introduction about sustainable finance, climate change and green economy. In particular, you will acquaint yourself with the basic skills and tools for applying the sustainable finance mechanisms to a real-world policy or business context.

Learning materials are taken from The One UN Climate Change Learning Partnership [UN CC:Learn](https://unccelearn.org/), which is a joint initiative of more than 30 multilateral organizations helping countries to achieve climate change action both through general climate literacy and applied skills development. [UN CC:Learn](https://unccelearn.org/) provides strategic advice and quality learning resources to help people, governments and businesses to understand, adapt, and build resilience to climate change.

See the earth’s global average surface temperature in 2021 tied with 2018 as the sixth warmest year on record, according to an analysis by NASA:
